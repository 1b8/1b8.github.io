Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunters

### **Draft of the plot**:
Jane Austen's body is, for whatever reason, moved to a tomb in America, near a town. In the nights following, villagers slowly disappear, one by one.
Mark Twain is on the scene, with Abraham Lincoln. They hunt down Jane Austen, and at the last minute, a wormhole opens, and some of the following pop out:
Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, One Direction. **We must also fit aliens in here somewhere.**

### **Casting ideas**:
Snape for Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber?

![Mark Twain: Vampire Hunter poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/mt-poster.jpg "Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunters")

Coming a cinema near you 2025. Or thereabouts.

### Draft of the plot:
Jane Austen's body is, for whatever reason, moved to a tomb in America, near a town. In the nights following, villagers slowly disappear, one by one.
Mark Twain is on the scene, with Abraham Lincoln. They hunt down Jane Austen, and at the last minute, a wormhole opens, and some of the following pop out:
Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, One Direction. **We must also fit aliens in here somewhere.**

### Casting ideas:
Snape for Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber?

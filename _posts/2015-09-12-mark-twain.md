Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunters

### **Draft of the plot**:
Jane Austen's body is moved to a tomb in America, near a town, because they needed room over at the other place. In the nights following, villagers slowly disappear, one by one.
Mark Twain is on the scene, with Abraham Lincoln. They hunt down Jane Austen, and reptillians try to prevent Abe and Mark from killing her because Vampires and reptillians are working together to take over the government. And at the last minute, a wormhole opens, and some of the following pop out:
Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, One Direction. **We must also fit aliens in here somewhere.**
The end will involve Mark Twain being bitten, and then it'll be something like this: https://youtu.be/5TwdUn8WqOk?t=19m8s
Abraham is Ellie and Mark Twain is Joel. Mark Twain will be bitten by a vampire and lie that's it's a scratch, and then Abraham will ask if he swears it's a scratch, and MT says "yeah yeah sure", and Abe knows that he's lying and says "Okay."

Mark Twain's father was thought to be dead, but he actually ran away to become one with the hamsters. He is now a hamster lord. 

### **Casting ideas**:
Snape for Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber?
